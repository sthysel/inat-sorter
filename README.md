# iNaturalist Photo sorter

I will go for a walk and take a bunch of photos of interesting shit along the
way. Sometime after I would download the previous few day's photos to upload to
iNaturalist. By this time the only cue to order photos together into
observations would be visual and manual time and position values. This tool
attempts to remove that manual burden by sorting a set of photos taken on a
excursion into a set of observations, each observation containing a set of
photos of the subject.
